# Mini Shopping Cart App

This is a mini shopping cart app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app consists of two pages: a products page and a cart page. It utilizes the `useReducer` hook and `createContext` to manage the application state in an efficient manner. The product list is hardcoded for simplicity, without any asynchronous data fetching.
